# Competition - Data Slayer 1.0 - MLC

## Notes
- This repository is intended to document my code for the Data Slayer 1.0 machine learning competition.
- Since this is an old competition, I've somewhat forgotten where I stored the modeling code, but the solution is simple.
- Data Cleaning + CatBoost + Outlier Handling + Soft Voting

## Interesting Findings:
- Outlier Must Be Analyzed
- Outlier Handling (Capping, Winsorizing, etc.)
- Ensemble Model (Stacking, Voting)
